## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 10.

Lab 10 was one we did on our own. It was a major teaching moment having to do all my problem solving on my own. It was interesting trying different things from searching for syntax examples, cutting out code or adding in samples. It really built up my ability to read and comprehend error messages. It has made the process of bug fixes much smoother overall now.

 Lab 11 part 2.

This lab was interesting since I did not know computers were deterministic. I think it's funny how randomness is something we don't really think much about, and the amount of code that goes into replicating it is pretty intensive and still not perfect. Definitely eye opening to things like online gambling and why power ball still uses actual balls.

Lab 12 part 1.

Definitely the most interesting and fun lab to see the result of! It was very cool to see how we could create an animated gif purely out of code. I especially find this interesting as an artist and the possibilities I can do to combine the two. It has definitely made me appreciate coding as a form of the art process.
